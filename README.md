## Solar System Model Assignment

## Description
This is a model of the solar system created as an assignment for the third semester of the ICT and Media Design profile in Fontys University of Applied Sciences. 

The project features a model of the solar system with the planets rotating in an orbit around the sun as well as information cards for each planet to help the users learn more about the solar system.

## Visuals

## Installation
Since the project is built entirely out of vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS there are no required steps to run the project.
If you try to open the HTML file directly you might run into a CORS error which may require third party software to disable CORS entirely. A workaround would be to run the code using a compiler or to access the project using the [official url](http://i477363.hera.fhict.nl/solar-system/).
